- `dropbox_transfer.py`: a utility for uploading or downloading files to/from Dropbox.
    - Requires an application API key available at the Dropbox developers site (https://www.dropbox.com/developers)
    - Requires Dropbox python SDK (`pip install dropbox`)
    - Uses Python3 (used with 3.5, have not tried later versions)
